Electric Vehicle Registration in California

For nowadays city life, the problems need to be solved are traffic jams, crowded spaces, inconveniences (too far from the public transportation system), and energy waste. 
At first, I really want to do my project topic with eVTOL (An aircraft uses electric power to hover, take off, and land vertically). It really helps people to solve the commuting problems. However, the dataset in this area is not that sufficient. So, I choose another topic which is related to the use of electricity for transportation, and my second favorite topic as well.
Highly automated driving can make driving safer, but also help improve our life or work efficiency. At the same time, the shared ride sharing mechanism brought about by autonomous driving can also reduce the number of vehicles, and the problems of traffic congestion and pollution in the city can be solved. 

I still want to stick to use tableau. It is because I think the user interface is good to use and it can set some parameters and calculate area for the plot which is more flexible than power BI.  Compare to other visualization tool, tableau is more familiar for me. And in the dashboard, the sheet layout can choose tile or float, it really saves more time for doing sizing the whole visualization time.
